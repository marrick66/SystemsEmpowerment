# Further Notes and Analysis for Empowerment in Systems

The components, teams, and individuals of an organization are heavily interdependent, which we model as a causal loop diagram illustrating the relationships and actions between them.

## A model of organizational operation with traditional feedback:

## A model of organizational operation with teams and individuals empowered to act:

While simple, these models show general patterns of behavior:

### The traditional model:
* Delay in idea communication results in larger periods of long and short term issues.
* Ideas stagnate and lose value when not acted on.
* Significantly less capital available for opportunities.

### An empowered model:
* Freedom to implement ideas sooner reduces long term issues and increases employee satisfaction, engagement, and inspiration.
* Encourages a problem-solving culture across all levels of the organization. 
* More capital and time available to invest in innovative opportunities.

## Mindsets that we want to see in leaders:
* Encourage organizational change in action, not just a shift in tools. Waterfall in Jira or Rally is still waterfall.
* Novel problems require creativity and experimentation, so innovation and design sprints should be protected and used for that purpose.
* There is no silver bullet. Product development is not manufacturing, and failures in conceptual understanding and communication will occur. They should be discovered as soon as possible, and not punished.
* Systems thinking promotes looking at behavior of the system over time. However, without knowledge of the internal structure, correcting unwanted behavior can be erratic.
