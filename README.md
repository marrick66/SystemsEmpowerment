# Further Notes and Analysis for Empowerment in Systems

The components, teams, and individuals of an organization are heavily interdependent, which we model as a causal loop diagram illustrating the relationships and actions between them.

## A model of organizational operation with traditional feedback:

While simple, these models show general patterns of behavior:

## The traditional model:
* Delay in idea communication results in larger periods of long and short term issues.
* Ideas stagnate and lose value when not acted on.
* Significantly less capital available for opportunities.

## An empowered model:
* Freedom to implement ideas sooner reduces long term issues and increases employee satisfaction, engagement, and inspiration.
* Encourages a problem-solving culture across all levels of the organization. 
* More capital and time available to invest in innovative opportunities.
